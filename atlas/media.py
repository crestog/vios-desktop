Playback.

*"The videos should be instantly playable also as I click them... lightning fast
speed, I don't care how you achieve this logic (how cunning, smart, pre-loading,
or very optimised, better architecture)."*

The honest problem: the video is a 5–40 MB file sitting in a Telegram channel,
and fetching it takes seconds. Nothing makes that transfer instant. So the trick
is to have already done it before the click happens.

Four mechanisms, in the order they pay off:

**Local first.** If Atlas is running on the machine that harvested the reel, the
file is already on disk and `video_index.local_path` points at it. Zero network.
This is the common case on Kaggle, and it is checked before anything else.

**Speculative prefetch.** Every search response kicks off downloads for the top
few results before the person has clicked anything. By the time the eye has
travelled to the first card, the file behind it is usually resident. This is the
single biggest win, and it costs bandwidth for videos nobody opens — which is
the right trade when the alternative is a spinner on every click.

**Hover intent.** The card asks for its video on `pointerenter` and on keyboard
focus. Between deciding to click and clicking, a person spends 200–400 ms;
that is not the whole download, but it is a head start and it is free.

**Range serving.** Playback goes through a hand-written 206 responder rather
than FileResponse, because seeking in a `<video>` element requires byte ranges
and Starlette only grew range support recently. Doing it here works on every
version, and lets a partially-downloaded file serve the bytes it already has.

**Nothing here is evicted.** Upstream this was an LRU cache bounded at 12 GB,
which is right on Kaggle's scratch disk — it is wiped between sessions anyway, so
nothing was precious and every file could be fetched again from the channel. On a
laptop that keeps its disk, a quota guarantees the opposite of what it looks like
it buys: the archive is never actually local, so every session pays Telegram's
rate limits over again. So this is a permanent local mirror with a *floor* rather
than a ceiling — `_check_floor` warns when the volume gets low and refuses to
delete anything. See `paths.FREE_FLOOR_GB`.

    records the message id. The table lands in Atlas generically — it is not in
    `reflect._ATLAS_OWN`, so `import_shard`'s inferred-table loop creates it from
    the shard's own columns.

    Which is why every failure here is `{}` rather than an exception. Three
    entirely normal databases have no usable row: one whose shards predate the
    upload (the `msg_id` column was all-NULL, and `_sql_type` drops an all-None
    column, so the table exists without it), one that has imported no shard
    carrying artifacts at all, and one whose `artifacts` pass failed for this

    table and a missing row have to be the same answer.

    Why "best" and not "the" row
    ────────────────────────────
    In the processing plane `(video_key, kind)` is the primary key, so there is
    exactly one row. In Atlas it is not: `ingest._dedup_columns` infers the
    unique key from a single shard's rows, and for this table more than one
    candidate is unique within a batch. So a re-rendered proxy uploaded to a new
    message can land as a second row rather than replacing the first, and taking
    whichever sqlite returns first would eventually point playback at a
    superseded message.

    Resolved here rather than by constraining the table, because a constraint
    inferred per shard cannot be relied on retroactively and this cannot be
    wrong: prefer a row that carries a message id, and among those the newest.
    Ordering happens in Python because `created_at` is not guaranteed to be a
    column — an all-None column is dropped at ingest, so `ORDER BY` on one that
    was dropped would take the whole lookup down.

    `local` means the harvester's own copy is still on disk — the fastest
    possible answer and the reason this check comes first. `cache` means Atlas
    downloaded it earlier. `remote` means it exists in the channel but not here
    yet, and `missing` means there is no message id to fetch it with.

    Two identities, not one
    ───────────────────────
    Every answer carries a **`cache_key`** as well as a `key`. They differ when
    the bytes on offer are not the original reel: the processing plane's
    `artifacts` pass renders a 480p `+faststart` proxy and now uploads it, and
    for playback that file is strictly better — two megabytes instead of forty,
    a moov atom at the front, and a seek that lands on the first request.

    So the proxy has to cache under its own name. Everything downstream —
    `_cache_path`, the `.sparse` file, `_sparse_index`, `fill`, `state` — is
    keyed by whatever string it is handed, and handing them the plain video key
    for proxy bytes would let `sparse_hit` return chunks of the *original* to a
    range computed against the *proxy's* length. That splice would play as
    corruption, so the two files get two keys and can never mix.

    Callers that only want to know "can this play, and from where" can keep
    ignoring the field; callers that touch the cache must pass `cache_key` on.

    Order of preference, and it changed when this became a laptop application.
    Upstream the original on disk beat everything, because the only alternative
    was a 480p proxy that had to be *downloaded* — so "already here" and "better
    quality" pointed the same way and there was nothing to trade off.

    Here `derive.py` renders a proxy locally from the original, so the choice is
    between two files that are both already on disk, and the proxy wins:
    `+faststart` puts the moov atom at the front where Instagram's own mp4s put
    it at the end, and a ~1 s GOP makes a seek land on a nearby keyframe. Those
    two facts are the difference between a click that paints in 150 ms and one
    that reads forty megabytes first. The original is still preferred over
    anything that needs the network, and it is still what the engine analyses —
    but the engine reads `KEYFRAME_DIR`, which was cut from the original at source
    resolution, so nothing that wants real pixels comes through here.

    Cheapest first, therefore: a locally derived proxy, then the original on
    disk, then a proxy Kaggle rendered and uploaded, then a channel fetch.

    The atomicity is the whole point of this function existing. Both callers
    used to hand ffmpeg `-y dest` directly, and `-y` truncates the output file
    on open — so a poster already being served went to zero bytes and grew back
    while a reader was mid-response. That produced a torn JPEG on screen, and
    on the wire it produced `RuntimeError: Response content longer than
    Content-Length` (and, when the race landed the other way, `shorter`) out of
    uvicorn, several times a session.

    It is not a rare interleaving. The cache filename keeps whole seconds while
    the URL keeps decimals, so `?t=12.3` and `?t=12.4` are two separate
    requests — separate browser cache entries, nothing dedupes them — that both
    render over `<key>_12.jpg`, at different seek positions, producing
    different-sized files. `poster()` and `clip_poster()` also name their output
    identically, so they race each other as well as themselves.

    `artifact_file` and `clip_fetch` in this same module already write to a temp
    path and `os.replace` into place; this is that pattern for the two ffmpeg
    render paths, with two differences forced by what they are:

    - the temp name keeps a `.jpg` suffix, because ffmpeg's image2 muxer picks
      the output format from the extension and a bare `.part` fails with
      "Unable to find a suitable output format".
    - the temp name is unique per writer rather than the shared `dest + ".part"`
      those two use, because they serialise on an in-flight Event and this does
      not — concurrent renders of the same second are the normal case here, and
      they must not share a scratch file.

    -ss before -i seeks by keyframe without decoding the file up to that point:
    milliseconds instead of seconds on a long clip. The frame may land slightly

    For the cover frame — `at` unset or zero — the processing plane has already
    rendered exactly this image and now uploads it, so the first thing tried is
    a ~30 KB download of a finished JPEG. That beats both alternatives outright:
    no ffmpeg, no video bytes, and it is the frame the plane itself chose.

    A positional request skips it, because a poster artifact is one frame and it
    is not the one being asked for. Those fall through to cutting the frame from

# CLIPS — the two-second segments that make playback instant
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# A clip is a complete, standalone, keyframe-aligned mp4 of about two seconds,
# cut at capture time and stored as its own channel message. Two things follow,
# and both are the point of the whole mechanism:
#
#   1. Playing a *moment* costs one small download, not a media session over
#      a whole reel. A 2 s clip is ~200-600 KB, which is inside the Bot API's
#      20 MB `getFile` ceiling — so it comes down over plain HTTPS with no
#      MTProto session, no sparse file, and no window arithmetic.
#   2. A frame can be extracted from a video the server has never held. The
#      clip is a real mp4, so `ffmpeg` reads it directly and `poster()` can
#      answer "the frame at 47 s" for a reel that was never downloaded.
#
# The clip is not a substitute for the full file — seeking freely and watching
# to the end still wants the whole reel, which the sparse path fetches in the
# background. Clips are what remove the wait *before* the first frame.

    trimmed. That is the whole trick behind seeking into a video nobody has

    the browser has its frame in one round trip instead of thirty.

    Chunks that go past are written into a sparse side-file, so a video watched

    timeline generates a dozen ranges in as many seconds. Paying that per seek
