Channel access.

Two transports, chosen per operation rather than per program:

  Bot API (HTTP)   getChat for the pinned manifest, and getFile for anything
                   under 20 MB. One request, no session file, no login. This is
                   the fast path Atlas uses on a cold start.
  MTProto (pyrogram)  everything the Bot API cannot do: reading an arbitrary
                   message by id, and downloading a file over 20 MB. Both are
                   required — the whole-channel scan is a walk over message ids,
                   and reels routinely exceed the HTTP download cap.

The one thing neither can do is list history. `messages.getHistory` is a
user-only method and returns BOT_METHOD_INVALID for a bot account, so there is
no "give me the last N messages" call available to us at all. The scan works
around it the way the harvester does: find the newest id by posting a message
and reading back its own id, then walk backwards asking for ids in batches.
Ids are dense enough in a channel that this is cheap, and it is the only method
a bot is actually permitted to use.

Pyrogram is async and Atlas's callers are not, so the client lives on its own
event loop in its own thread and every call out of here is a synchronous
wrapper with a deadline. That is deliberate: the bug that made the exporter
hang forever was an await with no timeout, and none of this code can repeat it.
