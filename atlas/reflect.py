"""
Schema reflection.

The requirement this file exists for: *"even if I change things, add or subtract
things from the database, it should still work, or require very very minimum
changes in code."*

The usual way to read a database is to write its column names into the program.
That works exactly until the schema moves. Add `frame_notes.pose_summary` and
the search index silently ignores it. Rename `chunks.description` and search
returns nothing, with no error anywhere. Drop a table and the UI throws.

So Atlas never names a column outside this module. It asks three questions at
runtime and derives everything else:

  1. What tables are here?              → `tables()`
  2. What does each column mean?        → role inference below
  3. Has any of that changed?           → `fingerprint()`

Role inference is the interesting part. Rather than matching a fixed list, each
column is scored against a small vocabulary of *roles* — the key that identifies
a video, the timestamps that place a row on the timeline, and the free text a
human would search. A new TEXT column is picked up as searchable content
automatically, because the rule is "text that is not an id, a path, or an
enum", not "one of these seven names". A renamed column is found as long as the
new name still reads like what it is.

Two rules here are stricter than they first look, and both are stricter on
purpose:

  A key must be *named* like a video key. The tempting fallback — "any single
  numeric primary key is the key" — attaches `categories(id=3, name='fitness')`
  to video 3. That is not a crash, it is worse: search quietly returns the wrong
  video. When the identity of a row is unknown, the row is not indexed.

  A blocked column suffix must be a whole token. Matching raw string suffixes
  drops `objects` for ending in "ts" and `format` for ending in "at". Names are
  split on separators and case changes, and only the final token is judged.

Nothing here raises on an unfamiliar schema. An unrecognised table becomes a
browsable table with no moments in it, which is the correct degradation: you can
still see the data, you just cannot search text Atlas could not identify as text.

# Atlas's own tables. They are derived from the others, so indexing them would

# column is a clip filename, timestamped and keyed by video, so left in it puts
# one `1234-c0007.mp4` passage into search per clip of every video.
#
# `vec_payload` is here for a different reason: it holds raw float buffers as
# BLOBs, which no reflection can describe and no reader would want to browse. It
# is written by `ingest`'s payload lane and read only by the image search that
# builds its index from it. `coverage` is here because it is the processing
# plane's work table — it says what ran, which means nothing to a search index.
#
# `scan_seen` is the incremental scan's memory: one row per Telegram message id
# with the verdict that settled it. Its `verdict` column is text, and reflection
# duly volunteered it as a search source on the first run of the new repo —
# `indexing 2 text source(s): map_point.source, scan_seen.verdict` — which would
# have put one "absent" or "no-document" passage into search per message in the
# channel. Thousands of them, all meaningless. Caught by reading the boot log,
# which is the argument for having one.
#
# `map_point` came out of that same log line, and it is an older bug: it is the
# UMAP projection `maps.py` writes, and its `source` column is a channel label
# ("speech", "ocr") rather than prose. Left in, it contributes one one-word
# passage per projected point — up to 180k of them, per `maps.py:114` — every one
# a duplicate of a label search already has as a facet. It was invisible because
# it only appears once a map has been built, and nothing read the log that said so.
