"""
vios.capture.backfill — asset sets for the videos that were captured first.

`publish_assets` runs inside a capture, in the one window where the bytes are on
disk and the anchor message id exists. That is the right place for it and it is
also the reason the archive is split in two: every video captured before Phase J
has a message in the channel and nothing beside it, so Atlas can only reach
those through a media session and a byte-range seek — the slow path the clips
exist to replace. Sixty-two videos on this channel are in that state, and no
amount of running the capture engine fixes them, because they are already
`uploaded` and will never be claimed again.

This module is the second window. It works from the ledger, which is the record
of what is in the channel, and for each video with no asset set it obtains the
bytes, cuts the clips, uploads them under the video's own message, and writes
the manifest id back. Three properties, each bought deliberately:

  Resumable.
      The ledger row is the state. A run that dies at video 40 resumes at 41
      because `needs_assets()` no longer returns the first 39. Nothing is held
      in memory that a restart would need.

  Paced.
      Fifteen documents per video against a channel with a per-minute budget is
      the shape that trips a 429, and a 429 during backfill would slow the
      capture engine sharing the same bot token. So there is a pause between
      clips (`assets.CHUNK_PAUSE`) and a longer one between videos
      (`VIOS_BACKFILL_PAUSE`).

  Cheap on bytes.
      The mp4 is already in Telegram, so getting it back is a download rather
      than an Instagram request — no cookies, no rate ladder, no account risk.
      Local disk is checked first, the Bot API second (it carries anything under
      20 MB, which is nearly every reel), and MTProto last, for the ones the Bot
      API refuses.

What it deliberately does not do: re-fetch anything from Instagram, touch a row
that is not `uploaded`, or fail a video for anything short of "the bytes cannot
be obtained". An asset set is an optimisation over data that is already safe.

One thing it must do before any of that, and did not: learn what the channel
holds. The ledger is a cache, it lives in scratch, and on a fresh session it is
empty while the channel holds every video this module exists for — so a pass that
counts before it scans concludes, correctly and uselessly, that there is nothing
to do. `_cycle` therefore seeds first and counts second, and repeats on an
interval so a video harvested at hour three is covered in the same session
instead of the next one.
