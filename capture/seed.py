vios.capture.seed — rebuild the ledger from the channel itself.

552 reels are already in Telegram, uploaded by the old Colab script over
months. Nothing in this repository knows about them: the ledger is new and
empty, and an empty ledger means "nothing captured", which would send the
capture engine off to re-download every one of them. That is a week of
Instagram requests spent to obtain files we already have, and a week of
requests is exactly the thing the pacer exists to avoid spending.

So before any run, the channel is read and the ledger is taught what is in it.

The channel is the ground truth
───────────────────────────────
Every uploaded message carries its permalink in the caption. That was true of
the old Colab captions and it is true of `upload.build_caption`, deliberately —
the `🔗 Link:` line is a load-bearing format, not decoration. As long as the
channel exists, the list of captured reels is recoverable with no database at
all. This module is the recovery.

Reading a channel as a bot
──────────────────────────
The Bot API has no `getHistory`; a bot cannot ask what is in a channel. Two
tricks get around it, both borrowed from `atlas.tgchannel` where they are
already proven against this exact channel:

  * The head id: post a message, keep the id it returns, delete it. That id is
    the current top of the channel, so the id space to scan is 1..head.
  * The body: MTProto's `get_messages` *can* read by id, even for a bot. Ids
    are requested in batches of 200; gaps (deleted messages, service events)
    come back as None and are dropped.

Scanning ~600 ids is three or four API calls, so this runs in seconds and is
cheap enough to do at the start of every session as a consistency check rather
than as a one-off migration.

Credentials are passed in, never imported. The scan needs an api id and hash
because MTProto does; if the operator has not supplied them, `seed_from_urls`
is the fallback — paste the list of already-uploaded links and the ledger
adopts them without reading anything.
